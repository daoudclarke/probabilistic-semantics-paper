Things to test out
==================

Can we learn about:
 - negation?
 - generalised quantifiers?
 - lexical entailment?
 - idiomatic/phrasal entailment?

Ideas:
 - Use entailment pairs

Eg:
 - cats like cheese -> animals like cheese
 - animals like cheese !> cats like cheese
 - cats like potatoes ?> animals like potatoes
